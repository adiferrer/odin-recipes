# The Odin Project: Foundations Project 1
The website constructed is a basic recipe website. This project reflects my understanding and practice of what I've learned in The Odin Project: HTML Foundations.
These recipes are quick to make and easy to follow, so why not give them a try? (Surely, Gordon Ramsay won't judge :D)
